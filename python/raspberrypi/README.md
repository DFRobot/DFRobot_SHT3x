# DFRobot_SHT3x
The SHT3x series chips are used to measure ambient temperature and relative humidity (the degree of moisture in the air, which indicates the degree to which the moisture content in the atmosphere is saturated from the atmosphere). 
It is a successor to the SHT2x series that contain the low-cost version of the SHT30, the standard version of SHT31, and the professional version of SHT35.
The SHT3x series temperature and humidity sensors adopt IIC communication which is easy to use, with a wide operating voltage range (2.15 to 5.5 V), and a space area of the chip package is 2.5 x 2.5 mm2 and 0.9 mm high, which can help SHT3x be easily integrated into a wide range of applications for a wide range of scenarios.
Based on brand-new optimized CMOSens® chip, SHT3x further improved its product reliability and accuracy specifications.
SHT3x offers a range of new features, e.g. enhanced signal processing, two unique user-selectable I2C addresses, an alarm mode with programmable temperature and humidity limits, and communication speeds up to 1 MHz.

You can choose to open or not open the heater
Heater Function
①By comparing the relative humidity and temperature values measured before and after heating, it is possible to determine whether the sensor is working properly.
②Using heaters in wet environments can avoid sensor condensation.
③A heater can also measure the dew point temperature (the temperature at which water vapor in the air turns into dewdrops).
The SHT3x chip offers two modes of operation:
1.Single measurement mode with an idle state current of 0.2 mA and low power consumption (measurement data is 600 mA).
2.Cycle measurement mode, where the idle state current is 45 mA, and in this mode ALERT starts to work(measurement data is 600 mA)
The following is the typical measurement accuracy of the chip (followed by this temperature and humidity range):

| Version No. | Typical Temp Precision (°C) | Typical Humidity Precision(%RH) | Range(Temp/Humidity) |
| ----------- | :-------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :------------------- |
| SHT30       |       ±0.2  @0-65 °C        |          ±2 @10-90% RH          | -40-125 °C/0-100 %RH |
| SHT31       |       ±0.2  @0-90 °C        |          ±2 @0-100% RH          | -40-125 °C/0-100 %RH |
| SHT35       |       ±0.1  @20-60°C        |         ±1.5 @0-80% RH          | -40-125 °C/0-100 %RH |

## Summary

   1.Read repeatability of the temperature and humidity data in single measurement mode, users can select the measure repeatability(the difference between the data measured by the chip under the same measurement conditions).
     The higher the repeatability is, the smaller the difference and the more dependable data will be.
   2.Read repeatability of the temperature and humidity data in cycle measurement mode, users can select the measure repeatability and the measure frequency(0.5Hz,1Hz,2Hz,4Hz,10Hz).
   3.The user can customize the threshold range. The ALERT pin and the Arduino's interrupt pin can achieve the effect of the temperature and humidity threshold alarm.

## Installation
To use this library, first download the library to Raspberry Pi, then open the routines folder. To execute one routine, demox.py, type python demox.py on the command line. To execute the get_gyro_accel_temp_data.py routine, for example, you need to type:

```
python periodic_data_reading.py
```
