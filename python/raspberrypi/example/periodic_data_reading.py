  # @brief Read ambient temperature (C/F) and relative humidity (%RH) in cycle read mode.
  # @n Experimental phenomenon: Before we start, please set the read frequency and repeatability of the read
  # (the difference between the data measured by the chip under the same measurement conditions),
  # and enter the periodic read mode, and then read the temperature and humidity data.
  # @n The temperature and humidity data will be printed at the serial port, after 10 seconds of operation.
  # @n It will exit the cycle mode and enter 2 measurement mode: Single measurement mode and Cycle measurement mode.
  # @n Single measurement mode: reflect the difference between the two modes of reading data.
  # @n Cycle measurement mode: the chip periodically monitors temperature and humidity, only in this mode the ALERT pin will work.
