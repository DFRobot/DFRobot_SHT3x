  # @brief Read ambient temperature (C/F) and relative humidity (%RH) in single-read mode.
  # @n Experimental phenomenon: the chip defaults in this mode, we need to send instructions to enable the chip collect data,
  # which means the repeatability of the read needs to be set (the difference between the data measured by the chip under the same measurement conditions)
  # then read the temperature and humidity data and print the data in the serial port.
  # @n Single measure mode: read data as needed, power consumption is relatively low, the chip idle state only costs 0.5mA.
